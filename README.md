#🌟 ElevateEdu


##🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the ElevateEdu—my solo venture into the world of online education! Over the past 4 weeks, 
I built this platform from scratch using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) and Spring Boot microservices. 
It’s designed to make the educational experience smoother for Admins, Instructors, and Students.

Dive into a seamless system where admins manage users, instructors create and oversee courses, and students enroll, review, and interact—all in one place.
