🌟**ElevateEdu**

🚀 **Introduction**
Welcome to the ElevateEdu—my solo venture into the world of online education! Over the past 4 weeks, 
I built this platform from scratch using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) and Spring Boot microservices. 
It’s designed to make the educational experience smoother for Admins, Instructors, and Students.

Dive into a seamless system where admins manage users, instructors create and oversee courses, and students enroll, review, and interact—all in one place.

**📝 My Story**
Building this platform was a rewarding journey. 
From the initial frustration with chaotic course management systems to developing a streamlined solution, 
this project is a testament to my dedication to improving educational experiences.


**Inspiration & Challenge**
This project was born out of my own experience with online learning platforms. Throughout my education, I found myself struggling with systems that were either overly complicated or lacked the features students and educators needed most. I wanted to create something better—an application that empowers admins, instructors, and students by making the learning experience smoother, more efficient, and user-friendly.

**The Challenge:** One of the biggest hurdles I faced was integrating multiple systems in a seamless way. Building the platform using a microservices architecture presented a significant challenge, especially when managing the communication between services for user management, course review, and notifications.

**What I Learned:** This project was a huge learning experience. From exploring the complexities of Java EE to understanding how microservices can scale effectively, it pushed me beyond my comfort zone and forced me to get creative with problem-solving. I also gained valuable insights into frontend development with Angular, learning how to create a responsive, role-based UI that enhances user experience.

**Next Iteration**
Looking forward, I envision a few key enhancements:

**Real-time notifications:** The current system is efficient, but introducing real-time notifications with websockets would provide an even better user experience.
**AI Integration:** Incorporating AI-driven recommendations for courses based on user behavior could make the platform more personalized and engaging for students.
Improved Scalability: I would invest more time into refining the system's architecture to ensure even greater scalability as the number of users grows.
Building this platform as a solo developer over a span of several weeks has been both challenging and rewarding. I’m excited about the potential it has, and I see plenty of opportunities for further development.
